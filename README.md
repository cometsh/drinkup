# Drinkup

Drinkup is an ELixir library for listening to events from an ATProtocol
firehose.

## Roadmap

- Support for different subscriptions other than
  `com.atproto.sync.subscribeRepo'
- Support for multiple instances at once, each with unique consumers (for
  listening to multiple subscriptions at once)
- Tests
